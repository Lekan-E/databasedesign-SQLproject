 All analysis and report were preformed by **Olamilekan Razak Elegbede** 


 ##  Introduction

 Along the years, stats/data has become a big part factor in how football is played and how players are being coached. <br />
 The inspiration for this project came after reading a book **The Expected Goals Philosophy by James Tippett** <br />
 My aim for this project to statistically compare how my favourite players performed in the 2022/2023 season as compared to the 2021/2022 season. I performed analysis based on playing positions (GK, DF, MID, ATT) from different players in the English Premier League. <br />
 Some data used for analysis were the following: <br/>
 * Expected Goals & Assists
 * Defensive Data i.e Tackles, Ball Recoveries, Interception
 * Attacking Data i.e Shots per 90, Takeon, Total Shots <br/>

 ## Methodology
 ### Analytical Tools
 The tools used for analysis includes:
 * MySQL - Database Management
         - Running Advanced Queries/Calculations
         - Comparison based on position and clubs
 * Microsoft Excel - For inserting data into the database

**NOTE**: Future Improvements includes Tableau for Visuzaliation.
