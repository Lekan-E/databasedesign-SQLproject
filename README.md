 ##  Introduction

 Along the years, stats/data has become a big part factor in how football is played and how players are being coached. <br />
 After reading a book **The Expected Goals Philosophy by James Tippett** is was inspired to work on this project. <br />
 My aim for this project to statistically compare how my favourite players performed as compared to seasons. The players used were my best players from different clubs around the English Premier League and I performed analysis based on playing positions (GK, DF, MID, ATT). <br />
 Some data used for analysis were the following: <br/>
 * Expected Goals & Assists
 * Defensive Data i.e Tackles, Ball Recoveries, Interception
 * Attacking Data i.e Shots per 90, Takeon, Total Shots
